# 0.6.0-beta.1 — KagNode Passwords preview

## Core integration preview

Shared local UI components, manual animated navigation, natural scrolling rails and icon account menus. Added separate appearance-only account connections and signed UI patch controls. Existing storage, native services and prior release records are retained.

## 0.6.0-beta.1 packaging.2

- Renamed the GitHub repository to kagnode-passwords and updated source/download links.
- Preserved legacy package identities, account client IDs and existing vault storage paths.

- Rename the interface while retaining existing encrypted data, identities and backup format.
- Add secure notes, folder labels and recoverable Trash with explicit permanent removal.
- Add a password-confirmed Bitwarden JSON export and Apps & extensions setup page.
- Integrate optional local-administrator update controls through KagNode CLI.
- Support an independently configured Vaultwarden engine; actual extension/mobile
  sign-in needs an HTTPS installation check. Existing vaults are not migrated automatically.
