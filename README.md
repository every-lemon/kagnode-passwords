# KagNode Passwords

## Overview

KagNode Passwords is the new name for KagNode Authenticator. Existing emails, master passwords, encrypted vaults, backup files and service/package identities remain compatible.

Independent email-based accounts with encrypted authenticator vaults and backup codes.

## Release status

Product source: **0.6.0-beta.1**. Packaging preview: **0.6.0-beta.1.packaging.2**.

Packaging prereleases do not change the latest stable release or establish new hardware or service compatibility. See [verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md) and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

- Secure notes and folder labels alongside saved logins, TOTP and recovery codes.
- Recoverable Trash with explicit restore and permanent removal.
- Optional Vaultwarden service for Bitwarden browser extensions and mobile applications. Existing vault data transfers only through an explicit export/import; the two stores do not silently synchronize.
- Local-administrator update controls backed by the KagNode CLI manager.
- Separate encrypted vaults for multiple email accounts.
- TOTP entries, passwords and backup-code storage.
- Dedicated account and vault routes, export and recovery controls.

Optional KagNode Account linking syncs your display name and photo after explicit approval. Your local application administrator can disable it. Local sign-in and permissions stay independent.

## Requirements

Python 3.12 for the validated development environment; HTTPS for remote use. See the existing reverse-proxy and vault setup instructions.

## Installation and downloads

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/every-lemon/kagnode-passwords/releases). Verify `SHA256SUMS` before extracting or installing a package.

| Payload | Formats | Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complete source / artwork | `.tar.xz`, `.tar.gz`, `.zip` | Named top-level directory; manual setup |
| Source preview | `.deb` | Source only; does not provision a service |
| Source preview | `.rpm` | Rocky Linux 10 packaging preview; native services unverified |

The GitHub repository is now `every-lemon/kagnode-passwords`. Existing native and source-package identities remain compatible.

The existing `authentactor` Debian package builder remains in packaging/build-deb.sh.

Source packages install under `/usr/share/kagnode/`; they do not replace an existing application, migrate data, start services or configure networking.  See [package details](docs/PACKAGING.md).

## Usage

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m authentactor
```

See [operations and existing setup instructions](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for the full workflow and its prerequisites.

## Configuration and storage

Shared presentation uses [KagNode Core](docs/CORE.md), with a pinned local fallback and reviewed server adapters. Compatible stable UI patches have a separate local-administrator policy.

The legacy authentactor package/service spelling is retained for compatibility. Never delete or reinitialize an existing vault to upgrade the UI.

## Security

Use HTTPS and least-privilege accounts for hosted services. Keep secrets and user data out of Git. Preview packages are for inspection and controlled testing; native service and hardware claims remain limited to recorded verification. See [security guidance](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Development and testing

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/repository_check.py
python3 scripts/format_source.py --check
python3 scripts/release.py --output dist/packages
```

Install the formatting dependencies from `requirements-format.txt`. Package building additionally needs `dpkg-deb`, `rpmbuild`, XZ support and, for CLI binaries, Go. Read [the repository map](docs/STRUCTURE.md) before editing generated files.
